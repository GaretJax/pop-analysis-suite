   Graphical overview of the workflow and the lifecycle of a measure in PAS.
   Each step will be described and the relevant pas command linked.

In the :ref:`quick-start` we have seen all steps needed to create an

from a practical point of view. In this document we will take a deeper look at

or adding different commands.
