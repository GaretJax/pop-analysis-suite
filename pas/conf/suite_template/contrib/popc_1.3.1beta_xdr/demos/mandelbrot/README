This is a generator of Mandelbrot fractal. The drawing board is split in tiles that are computed parallely on different stations. 

The nbWorkers argument specifies the number of stations use to share the calculations. The contact address of the stations must be specified in machines.ip. 


Compiling:
You need QT3 development headers 
On Debian/Ubuntu these files are provided by the package libqt3-mt-dev


Argument:
num-careaux real-min real-max imag-min imag-max nbWorkers

example:
2 -0.743650449 -0.743635821 0.131818649 0.131833277 1

Executing
../../bin/parocrun obj.map ./fractal.master 2 -1.743650449 1.043635821 -1.131818649 1.131833277 1
