"""
The pas package provides the necessary commands and their underlying libraries
to interact with a VM based POP Analyzing Suite environment.

Most of the functionalities are described by the pas command-line script
documentation and its related subcommands. Take a look to their docstring to
obtain further information about he usage.

The commands are mainly a thin wrapper around library calls to functions
inside the various modules contained in the root pas package. To use pas as a 
python library call the functions directly, without invoking the commands. The
functions docstring should provide enough information about their usage. You
may also refer to the various command implementations for examples about their
necessity of some context to be set.
